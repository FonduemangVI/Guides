Some of these guides were started by us and are now maintained by the Bazarr team.

- [Basic-Guide](https://wiki.bazarr.media/Getting-Started/Setup-Guide/){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - The basic set up needed to get started with Bazarr (*external link to the official most up-to-date Bazarr guide*).
- [After Install Configuration](https://wiki.bazarr.media/Getting-Started/First-time-installation-configuration/){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - Bazarr only searches for subtitles for Episodes and Movies that are added after the install, So you will need to set the preferred languages for your existing Shows and Movies. (*external link to the official most up-to-date Bazarr guide*).
- [Suggested Scoring](/Bazarr/Bazarr-suggested-scoring/) - Suggested scores that would work with the most common languages, with this scoring 99% of your downloaded subtitles should be the correct ones for your release.
- [Scripts](/Bazarr/scripts/) - The start of a collection of community-provided and maintained scripts for Bazarr, that only should be used if you have a specific need for it.
